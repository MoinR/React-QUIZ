# My-React-APP
Playing with basics of react - js 

In this project I have created below components. 
  - Basic routing 
  - Component with redux. 
  - API calls using promises. 

To run this project in your system run below commands  

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MoinR/My-React-APP.git
cd My-React-APP 
npm i && npm start 
```

Running above command will clone repository in current working directory and will install the required libraries and 
if libraries are installed successfully then project will run in your default browser

Thank you
